To Whom It May Concern, \\

\paragraph{}
My name is Baojia (or you may have known me as Tony) Tong, and I'm applying to the academic position at the \textbf{XXX}. Currently, I am a member of ATLAS collaboration, and plan to complete my Ph.D. at Harvard University in May, 2018.

\paragraph{}
My physics interest has been the search for $X \to HH \to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ at ATLAS, especially in the boosted regime. Di-higgs is not only one of the most challenging measurements in the next decade, but also a powerful probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. I have been one of the lead analyzers on the boosted analysis since 2015 and continued my searches using full 2016 data, which will be my Ph.D. thesis. For detector and operational work, I have been actively involved in the ATLAS Muon Detector Monitoring and Muon Reconstruction improvements since early 2015.

\paragraph{}
\textbf{XXX to be updated }

\paragraph{}
Included in this application is a curriculum vitae, which also contains the list of publications, and a research statement, where my past experiences are explained in more detail. My dissertation advisor Melissa Franklin, Professor Mel Shochet, Dr. Christoph Amelung and Dr. Michael Kagan have been extremely helpful and instrumental throughout my time at Harvard University and CERN. Thus, I have requested four letters of recommendation from them to be submitted to you.

\paragraph{}
Thanks for your time and consideration!
